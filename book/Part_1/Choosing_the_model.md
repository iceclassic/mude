# Part 1. Applying MUDE concepts

In the first part of the book, we will use a pragmatic approach to apply some of the key concepts that we will learn in MUDE.

 Details about the theory behind some of the concepts can be found in the lectures and MUDE interactive book. 
 Similarly, some programming aspects will not be directly covered here, as they are discussed in the Programming Assignment  and Friday's  Assignments. However, we will introduce some programming concepts that were not discussed directly in MUDE.
