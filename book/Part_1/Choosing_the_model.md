# Part 1. Understanding the problem

We will be using `pandas` in the preprocessing stage, in particular we will  organize, group, manipulate and visualize time series data.

For those unfamiliar with `pandas` , it may be a good idea to review the corresponding chapter in the self pace online course [Python for Engineers](https://teachbooks.github.io/learn-python/06/Theory/01.html). Regardless, brief explanations and exercises will be given throughout the book, but they will focus on the application rather than the codding.



Additionally, we will use the purpose-built [`iceclassic`](https://test.pypi.org/project/iceclassic/ ) package.
