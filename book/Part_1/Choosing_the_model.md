We will be using `pandas`in the preprocessing stage as is easy to organize , group, explore data ads is is very efficient to manipulate time series data.

For those unfamiliar with `pandas` , it may be a good idea to review the corresponding chapter in the self pace online course [Python for Engineers](https://teachbooks.github.io/learn-python/06/Theory/01.html). Regardless, brief explanations and exercises will be given throughout the book, but they will focus on the application rather than the theory.



Additionally, we will use the purpose-built [`iceclassic`](https://test.pypi.org/project/iceclassic/ ) package.
