# Part 1. Applying MUDE concepts

In the first part of the book, we will take a pragmatic approach by applying the concepts learned in MUDE. Details about the theory behind these techniques can be found in the lectures and MUDE interactive book. Similarly, some programming aspects will not be directly covered here, as they are discussed in the PA and Friday assignments. However, we will introduce some potentially useful new programs throughout the book.
