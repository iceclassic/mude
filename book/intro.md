# Welcome to the iceclassic book!! A MUDE Sidequest

The iceclassic book contains additional (and optional) content to the main MUDE interactive book. Throughout the book, we will tackle a single problem: the Nenana Ice Classic.

In the first part, we will familiarize ourselves with the problem, find, choose, and preprocess data that might be pertinent to the problem.

In the second part, we will build a few simple models to try to solve the problem at hand.

Throughout the book, we will use the programming techniques you will learn during the lectures and workshops, and briefly introduce new techniques.



## Nenana Ice Classic

The Nenana Ice Classic is an annual betting contest in Alaska where participants predict the exact day and time the ice will break on the Tanana River.

Originating in 1906 as a small betting pool among six friends, the first winner, Oliver Lee, received a reward equivalent to "a couple of rounds at the trading post bar." Over the years, the contest has grown significantly. This year, tickets are available for $3 each, and the total prize pool has reached \$210,155.

Each year, a tripod is set up on the ice during the first weekend in March. The break-up time is determined using a unique system where the clock stops once the tripod, connected by a pulley system, has drifted 100 feet downstream.

You can see last year's ice break-up [here](https://youtu.be/hNCz1C4fkqo?list=PLo0kgRXad08K-7DV00t4WNzKaaHovr2wi&t=208). For more information, visit the official Nenana Ice Classic [webpage](https://www.nenanaakiceclassic.com/).

## Motivation

Last year, on the last friday's assignment every MUDE group submitted a guess, the results can be seen in the next figure

 ![Fig.1](../figures/Part1/2024_guesses_with_breakup.png)

in average they were off by almost a week. There is a lot of room for improvement!!!

> mention how to contribute, and invitation to MUDE Q3 2024-25?
