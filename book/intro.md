# Welcome to the iceclassic book, a MUDE Sidequest.

## Nenana Ice Classic
The Nenana Ice Classic is a betting contest that takes place every year. The bet consist in predicting   day and time the river ice in the Tanana River, Alaska will
break apart along the waterfront of the town Nenana.

The Ice Classic originated in 1906 as a betting pool by six friends, the first winner Oliver Lee,  earn the  equivalent reward of "a couple of rounds at the trading post bar. This year you can buy a ticket for \$3 and the pool had a value of \$210,155.

A tripod is constructed on the ice during the first weekend in March. Break-up time is
determined as follows: "The Tripod is setup with a unique pulley and clock system that stops
the clock once the tripod has moved downstream by 100 ft".

You can see this year's break up on the following [link](https://youtu.be/hNCz1C4fkqo?list=PLo0kgRXad08K-7DV00t4WNzKaaHovr2wi&t=208) or visit teh official [webpage](https://www.nenanaakiceclassic.com/).

##  Motivation
Throughout the quarter we will make use of the contents of MUDE to create a model that can  predict the break-up or get as close as possible.

 Last year's prediction can be seen in the following figure:

There is a lot of room for improvement.The question is then, what model and what data will we use this year?
