## Nenana Ice Classic
The Nenana Ice Classic is a betting contest that takes place every year. The bet consist in predicting  the day and time of ice break in the Tanana River, Alaska.


The Ice Classic originated in 1906 as a betting pool by six friends, the first winner Oliver Lee,  earn the  equivalent reward of "a couple of rounds at the trading post bar. This year you can buy a ticket for \$3 and the pool had a value of \$210,155.

A tripod is constructed on the ice during the first weekend in March. Break-up time is
determined as follows: "The Tripod is setup with a unique pulley and clock system that stops
the clock once the tripod has moved downstream by 100 ft".

You can see this year's break up on the following [link](https://youtu.be/hNCz1C4fkqo?list=PLo0kgRXad08K-7DV00t4WNzKaaHovr2wi&t=208) and visit the official [webpage](https://www.nenanaakiceclassic.com/) for more details

##  Motivation
Throughout the quarter we will use what we are (an will) learn in  MUDE to create a model that can predict the break-up or get as close as possible.

 Last year's prediction can be seen in the following figure:

> it is not shown in the plot, but this guesses are from two groups, MUDE Students, and people in  'MUDE lunch meetings'.
> As we have two populations we can use statistical test to determine
> :          Are the two population samples different ( compare mean, stv of residuals). Same population? one better than other?

There is a lot of room for improvement!!!
