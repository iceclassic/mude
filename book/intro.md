# Welcome to the iceclassic book!!. A MUDE Sidequest

The iceclassic book contains additional (and optional) content to the main MUDE book. This interactive books focusses in applying the programming concepts of MUDE to create a simple model.

Unlike the MUDE interactive book, the PAs  or the friday's assignments, we will use apply most of the concept to the same problem, in order to understand how they can complement each other, how they differ, etc.

## Nenana Ice Classic

The Nenana Ice Classic is an annual betting contest in Alaska where participants predict the exact day and time the ice will break on the Tanana River.

Originating in 1906 as a small betting pool among six friends, the first winner, Oliver Lee, received a reward equivalent to "a couple of rounds at the trading post bar." Over the years, the contest has grown significantly. This year, tickets are available for $3 each, and the total prize pool has reached \$210,155.

Each year, a tripod is set up on the ice during the first weekend in March. The break-up time is determined using a unique system where the clock stops once the tripod, connected by a pulley system, has drifted 100 feet downstream.

You can see last year's ice break-up [here](https://youtu.be/hNCz1C4fkqo?list=PLo0kgRXad08K-7DV00t4WNzKaaHovr2wi&t=208). For more information, visit the official Nenana Ice Classic [webpage](https://www.nenanaakiceclassic.com/).

## Motivation

Last year, every MUDE group submitted a guess, and on average we were off by almost a week

There is a lot of room for improvement!!!

## Scope

The book is divided into two parts.

#### Part 1 - Applying MUDE concepts

In the first part, we will individually apply each MUDE concept to a subset of the main problem.
We will also focus on programming aspect related to the use of Pandas and other programming aspects that might have been overlooked during MUDE.

#### Part 2 Building a model
n the second part of the book, we will clearly define the problem at hand. Based on this, we will outline the objectives our model needs to achieve and detail how the model will accomplish these goals.
