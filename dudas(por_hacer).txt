Cachos, por hacer, dudas varias y cosas que arreglar
______________________________________________

Repositories
-	mude 
o	Teachbooks
______________________________________________
Part 1: Exploring the data and plotting stuff
______________________________________________
•	When embedding the video, the video play from the beginning even though the url has timestamp
-	Do not like the figure showing last years'guesses make it prettier
•	Mention FAIR Data practices? Or will be mention in MUDE book
•	Upload to GH gage heigh datssa
•	Interactive geo map
		- Fix loading time / resolution of river
		-Add isoclines layer?
		- Embed HTML or run function that created the plot in the notebook?
o	Explain spline math?
o	Explain welch periodogram, windows, filters? ( could link to course later in the Msc where they are explained/ or just the MUDE textbook)
______________________________________________
Part 2:  Simple models
______________________________________________
o	Documentation for classes and method ( not 100 % consistent, also doc @proporerties better)
- 	Model methods:
	- 1D Polynomial (add multidimensional support)
	- Single variable distribution ( add multivariate support?(prob not)
	- 1D simple NN (can change architecture but for 1D is alway almost like linear regression) [not fully implemented]
	- Simple KNN classification [not fully implemented]
	- ice_growth ( only temp) [not fully implemented]
	Build doc sphinx and host in read_the_docs?
	I know it can be hosted in gh-pages but would need to create gh action to updated (never done this before, but seem straightforward enough)
o	Collection of functions to explore data vs  class (give name to submodule ( explore _ice_data? same package I assume)
o	BMI 'wrapper' ( create once the basic oop model is at least correct  contents/structure wise)

______________________________________________
Data files
______________________________________________
o	where do we put file with the compiled df and the individual df/files?
o	A test PyPi package was uploaded to the test index
	 \https://test.pypi.org/project/iceclassic/  
	Is there any organization group in PyPI to manage access? 
	If no,  see how to set up multiple API token to manage updating/upload 
______________________________________________ 
MISC
______________________________________________
-	proper testing? Not really 
-	Remember to get list of install packages from my venv to put in requirement.txt
o	License, readme and description of PyPi => same as the ones set-up in github repo 
	.toml
		could not get dynamic version tags to work, static for the moment
		dependencies field(smth to do with 'poetry')

MUDE Q3_v2 ?
______________________________________________ 
How do we set up repos for collaboration of student's pull requests () ? Multiple options, discus with prof
